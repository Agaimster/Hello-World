# Hello-World
Basic tutorial

I'm a 31 year old pharmacist that is wanting to change my career and become a programmer.
During my efforts to identify other career opportunities I took a Myers-Briggs personality test that came up INTP which corrisponds with a logical way of thinking and behaving and is generally well suited to engineering and development roles.
I've always been interested in developing programs and research into AI so I figured I will at least learn a bit about it to decide if it's for me.

I like pizza.
